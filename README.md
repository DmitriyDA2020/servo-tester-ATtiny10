# CCPM servo tester
The simplest CCPM servo tester based on the ATtiny10 microcontroller. 
The device has three parallel PWM channels for connecting servos or ESCs.

Three operating mode:
- Analog mode (The position of the servo (ESC turns) depends on the position of the potentiometer knob)
- Center position mode
- Auto mode (position automatically changes from minimum to maximum and vice versa)

Input voltage: 4.5 - 5.5 volt
PWM: 50 Hz, 1 - 2 ms
